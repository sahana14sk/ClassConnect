ClassConnect is an AI-powered PDF chatbot designed to make document understanding easier, faster, and interactive. It allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions directly about the content, eliminating the need to manually search through lengthy documents. The system extracts both text and images from the PDF and uses semantic search to return accurate, context-based responses along with page reference. Built with Streamlit, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS vector search, ClassConnect acts as a smart study and research companion—helping users quickly find explanations, visuals, definitions, and related information through a smooth conversational interface.
